Privacy Policy for Note Pad Pro

Last updated: January 2026

1. Introduction

Welcome to Note Pad Pro. Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how our app handles user data, permissions, and third‑party services.

Note Pad Pro is designed primarily as an offline note‑taking application. We do not require users to create an account or provide personal information to use the app.

2. Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or sell any personal data such as:

Name

Email address

Phone number

Contacts

Location data


All notes and user‑generated content are stored locally on the user's device.


---

3. Permissions We Use

Note Pad Pro requests certain permissions strictly to provide core app functionality:

Notifications: Used to show reminders and sticky note notifications set by the user.

Storage / Media Access: Used for local backups (JSON), restoring data, exporting notes as PDF, and sharing files.

Overlay (System Alert Window): Required for the Floating Note feature to allow notes to appear over other apps.

Biometric Authentication: Used to lock and unlock the app securely. Biometric data is handled entirely by the Android system and is never accessed or stored by us.

Camera (optional, feature‑based): Used only for OCR (Image‑to‑Text) and QR code scanning features. Images are processed locally and are never uploaded to any server.


We do not request any permission that is not directly related to app functionality.


---

4. Data Storage & Security

All notes, backups, and settings are stored locally on your device.

The app does not transmit user data to our servers.

App lock and biometric security rely on Android system‑level security mechanisms.


If you choose to export or share backups (for example, via cloud storage or messaging apps), this action is fully controlled by the user.

5. Third‑Party Services

Note Pad Pro uses third‑party services only to support app functionality:

Start.io Advertising SDK

Used to display advertisements in the free version of the app.

Start.io may collect anonymous and aggregated usage data in accordance with their own privacy policy.



We do not share personal user data with advertisers.

6. Children’s Privacy

Note Pad Pro is suitable for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
